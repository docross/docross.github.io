	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I am currently a Senior Product Engineer at <em>Micron Technology Inc.</em> where I work on all kinds of exciting DRAM related projects.  
  I love to work on problems that lie at the intesection between pushing Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) capabilites to their limits
  and exploring novel Design For Test (DFT) methodologies.</p>
  <p>I also really enjoy exploring semiconductor manfucturing process and test yields using rather large datasets using Python tools such as Pandas and Dask.</p>
