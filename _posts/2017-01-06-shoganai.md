# しょうがない (Shoganai)
The title of this post is a Japanese term that I felt fittingly described the state of stoicism I attempted to reach over my Christmas break.  Per [Maria Sugio](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/11-beautiful-untranslatable-japanese-words), _"The literal meaning of "Shoganai" is "it cannot be helped." However, it is not discouraging or despairing. It means to accept that something was out of your control. It encourages people to realize that it wasn't their fault and to move on with no regret."_ 
Sounds lofty eh?  Of course I must admit that that I did not intentionally, or even willingly, pursue this state of mind.  In reality it was a necessary survival mechanism for my nearly Griswold holiday hiatus.
